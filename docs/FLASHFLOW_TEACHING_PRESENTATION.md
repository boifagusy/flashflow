### 2. Getting Started (15 minutes)

#### A. Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/flashflow.git
cd flashflow
pip install -e .
```

#### B. Creating First Project
```bash
flashflow new my-first-app
cd my-first-app
flashflow install core
```

#### C. Running the Application
```bash
flashflow build
flashflow serve --all
```

### 3. Core Concepts (20 minutes)

#### A. .flow Files
- YAML-based syntax
- Define entire application
- Single source of truth

#### B. Three Main Sections
1. **Models** - Data structure
2. **Pages** - User interface
3. **Endpoints** - API routes

#### C. Example .flow File
```yaml
model:
  name: "Todo"
  fields:
    - name: "task"
      type: "string"
      required: true

page:
  title: "Todo List"
  path: "/todos"
  body:
    - component: "todo_list"

endpoint:
  path: "/api/todos"
  method: "GET"
```

### 4. Hands-on Exercise 1: Todo App (25 minutes)

#### A. Create Todo Model
```yaml
model:
  name: "Todo"
  fields:
    - name: "task"
      type: "string"
      required: true
    - name: "completed"
      type: "boolean"
      default: false
```

#### B. Create Todo Page
```yaml
page:
  title: "My Todos"
  path: "/todos"
  body:
    - component: "todo_form"
    - component: "todo_list"
```

#### C. Create API Endpoints
```yaml
endpoint:
  path: "/api/todos"
  method: "POST"
  request:
    task:
      type: "string"
      required: true
```

#### D. Build and Test
```bash
flashflow build
flashflow serve --all
```

### 5. Advanced Features (20 minutes)

#### A. Authentication
```yaml
authentication:
  providers:
    - name: "local"
      type: "email_password"
  roles:
    - name: "admin"
    - name: "user"
```

#### B. Relationships
```yaml
model:
  name: "Post"
  fields:
    - name: "user_id"
      type: "foreign_key"
      references: "users.id"
```

#### C. Real-time Features
```yaml
websocket:
  connection: "chat"
  path: "/ws/chat"
```

### 6. Hands-on Exercise 2: Blog Application (30 minutes)

#### A. Define Models

- Login/logout

### 7. Testing and Deployment (15 minutes)

#### A. Writing Tests
```yaml
test:
  name: "Post Creation"
  steps:
    - action: "visit"
      url: "/admin/posts/new"
    - action: "fill"
      field: "title"
      value: "Test Post"
    - action: "click"
      element: "submit"
```

#### B. Running Tests
```bash
flashflow test
flashflow test --coverage
```

#### C. Deployment
```bash
flashflow build --production
flashflow deploy
```

### 8. Best Practices and Tips (10 minutes)

#### A. Project Organization
- Modular .flow files
