## Overview

Team management in FlashFlow is built around three core concepts:

1. **Roles**: Predefined sets of permissions that can be assigned to users
2. **Permissions**: Granular access controls for specific actions or resources
3. **Access Control**: Mechanisms to protect pages and API endpoints based on roles

FlashFlow automatically generates user management interfaces and provides tools for administrators to manage team members.

## User Roles and Permissions

FlashFlow supports a flexible role-based access control (RBAC) system with the following default roles:

### Default Roles

- **Super Administrator**: Full access to all features and settings
- **Administrator**: Access to most features with some restrictions
- **Editor**: Can create and modify content but cannot manage users
- **Viewer**: Read-only access to content

### Custom Roles

You can define custom roles in your project configuration:

```json
{
  "name": "my-project",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "authentication": {
    "roles": [
      {
        "name": "project_manager",
        "display_name": "Project Manager",
        "permissions": [
          "project.read",
          "project.update",
          "team.read",
          "team.update"
        ]
      },
      {
        "name": "developer",
        "display_name": "Developer",
        "permissions": [
          "code.read",
          "code.write",
          "deployment.create"
        ]
      },
      {
        "name": "stakeholder",
        "display_name": "Stakeholder",
        "permissions": [
          "project.read",
          "reports.read"
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Permission Structure

Permissions follow a hierarchical naming convention:
- `{resource}.{action}` (e.g., `user.create`, `project.delete`)
- Wildcard permissions using `*` (e.g., `admin.*` for all admin permissions)

## Defining Roles in .flow Files

You can define roles and permissions directly in your .flow files using the authentication section:

```yaml
# Authentication configuration
authentication:
  providers:
    - name: "local"
      type: "email_password"
    - name: "google"
      type: "oauth2"
      client_id: "{{ env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID }}"
  jwt:
    secret: "{{ env.JWT_SECRET }}"
    expiration: "24h"
  verification:
    email: true
    phone: true
  roles:
    - name: "admin"
      default: false
      permissions:
        - "user.*"
        - "content.*"
        - "settings.*"
    - name: "editor"
      default: false
      permissions:
        - "content.read"
        - "content.create"
        - "content.update"
    - name: "viewer"
      default: true
      permissions:
        - "content.read"
```

## Page-Level Access Control

Protect pages by specifying required roles or permissions:

```yaml
# Protected page - only accessible by admins
page:
  title: "Admin Dashboard"
  path: "/admin"
  auth:
    required: true
    roles:
      - "admin"
  body:
    - component: "admin_dashboard"

# Page with multiple allowed roles
page:
  title: "Content Management"
  path: "/content"
  auth:
    required: true
    roles:
      - "admin"
      - "editor"
  body:
    - component: "content_manager"

# Page with specific permissions
page:
  title: "User Settings"
  path: "/settings"
  auth:
    required: true
    permissions:
      - "user.update"
  body:
    - component: "user_settings"
```

## API Endpoint Protection

Protect API endpoints with role-based or permission-based access control:

```yaml
# Protected API endpoint
endpoint:
  path: "/api/users"
  method: "GET"
  auth:
    required: true
    roles:
      - "admin"
  response:
    type: "array"
    model: "User"

# Endpoint with specific permissions
endpoint:
  path: "/api/users/{id}"
  method: "PUT"
  auth:
    required: true
    permissions:
      - "user.update"
  request:
    email:
      type: "string"
      required: true
    name:
      type: "string"
      required: true
  response:
    type: "object"
    model: "User"

# Public endpoint
endpoint:
  path: "/api/public/info"
  method: "GET"
  auth:
    required: false
  response:
    app_version:
      type: "string"
    build_date:
      type: "string"
```

## Admin Panel Team Management

FlashFlow automatically generates an admin panel with team management features:

### User Management Interface

The admin panel includes a comprehensive user management interface that allows administrators to:

1. View all users in the system
2. Create new user accounts
3. Edit existing user information
4. Assign roles to users
5. Activate or deactivate user accounts
6. Reset user passwords
7. View user activity logs

### Role Management

Administrators can manage roles through the admin panel:

1. View all defined roles and their permissions
2. Create new custom roles
3. Modify existing role permissions
4. Assign default roles for new users
5. View role assignment statistics

### Team Collaboration Features

The admin panel includes collaboration tools:

1. **Team Activity Feed**: Real-time updates on team activities
2. **User Session Management**: View and manage active user sessions
3. **Audit Logs**: Detailed logs of all user actions
4. **Bulk Operations**: Perform actions on multiple users at once

## Collaborative Features

FlashFlow includes several built-in features to support team collaboration:

### Real-time Collaboration

```yaml
# Enable real-time updates for collaborative features
websocket:
  connection: "collaboration"
  path: "/ws/collaborate"
  authentication: required

streams:
  document_updates:
    type: "real_time"
    source: "documents"
    on_change: "broadcast_update"
```

### Shared Workspaces

Define shared workspaces for team collaboration:

```yaml
model:
  name: "Workspace"
  fields:
    - name: "name"
      type: "string"
      required: true
    - name: "description"
      type: "text"
    - name: "owner_id"
      type: "foreign_key"
      references: "users.id"
    - name: "team_members"
      type: "json"  # Array of user IDs
    - name: "created_at"
      type: "timestamp"
      auto: true

page:
  title: "Workspace Dashboard"
  path: "/workspaces/{id}"
  auth:
    required: true
    permissions:
      - "workspace.access"
  body:
    - component: "workspace_header"
    - component: "team_member_list"
    - component: "collaborative_editor"
```

### Notification System

Set up notifications for team collaboration:

```yaml
# Notification templates for team management
notification_templates:
  - name: "user_added_to_team"
    title: "You've been added to a team"
    body: "You have been added to the {{ team_name }} team by {{ inviter_name }}."
    category: "team"
    action_buttons:
      - text: "View Team"
        action: "view_team"
        data:
          team_id: "{{ team_id }}"

  - name: "role_changed"
    title: "Your role has been updated"
    body: "Your role in {{ team_name }} has been changed to {{ new_role }}."
    category: "team"

  - name: "team_invitation"
    title: "Team invitation"
    body: "{{ inviter_name }} has invited you to join {{ team_name }}."
    category: "team"
    action_buttons:
      - text: "Accept"
        action: "accept_invitation"
        data:
          invitation_id: "{{ invitation_id }}"
      - text: "Decline"
        action: "decline_invitation"
        data:
          invitation_id: "{{ invitation_id }}"
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Role Design

- Follow the principle of least privilege
- Create roles based on job functions rather than individuals
- Regularly review and update role permissions
- Use hierarchical roles when possible

### 2. Access Control

- Always require authentication for sensitive operations
- Use specific permissions rather than broad role checks when possible
- Implement both frontend and backend access controls
- Log access attempts for security monitoring

### 3. Team Management

- Establish clear onboarding processes for new team members
- Regularly review team member access and roles
- Implement proper offboarding procedures
- Maintain audit logs of all team-related activities

### 4. Security

- Use strong password policies
- Implement multi-factor authentication
- Regularly rotate secrets and API keys
- Monitor for suspicious activity

### 5. Collaboration

- Use descriptive role names and permissions
- Document team workflows and processes
- Implement clear communication channels
- Establish team guidelines and best practices

## Example Implementation

Here's a complete example of implementing team management for a project management application:

```yaml
# Project management application with team features

# Define custom roles
authentication:
  roles:
    - name: "project_owner"
      display_name: "Project Owner"
      permissions:
        - "project.*"
        - "team.*"
        - "reports.*"
    - name: "project_manager"
      display_name: "Project Manager"
      permissions:
        - "project.read"
        - "project.update"
        - "team.read"
        - "team.update"
        - "reports.read"
    - name: "developer"
      display_name: "Developer"
      permissions:
        - "project.read"
        - "task.*"
        - "code.read"
    - name: "stakeholder"
      display_name: "Stakeholder"
      permissions:
        - "project.read"

  name: "TeamMembership"
  fields:
    - name: "team_id"
      type: "foreign_key"
      references: "teams.id"
      required: true
    - name: "user_id"
      type: "foreign_key"
      references: "users.id"
      required: true
    - name: "role"
      type: "string"
      required: true
    - name: "joined_at"
      type: "timestamp"
      auto: true

# Protected team dashboard
page:
  title: "Team Dashboard"
  path: "/teams/{id}"
  auth:
    required: true
    permissions:
      - "team.read"
  body:
    - component: "team_header"
    - component: "team_members_list"
    - component: "team_projects"
    - component: "team_activity_feed"

# API endpoint to manage team members
endpoint:
  path: "/api/teams/{id}/members"
  method: "POST"
  auth:
    required: true
    permissions:
      - "team.update"
  request:
    user_id:
      type: "string"
      required: true
    role:
      type: "string"
      required: true
  response:
    status:
      type: "string"
    message:
      type: "string"
```

This team management system provides a solid foundation for collaborative applications while maintaining security and access control.
