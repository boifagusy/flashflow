## Prerequisites and Setup

### System Requirements

Before starting with FlashFlow, ensure you have:

- **Python 3.8 or higher** installed on your system
- **Node.js 14 or higher** for frontend development
- **PHP 8.0 or higher** for backend development
- **Composer** for PHP dependencies
- **SQLite** (default) or **MySQL/PostgreSQL** for database
- **Git** for version control

### Installing FlashFlow

1. Clone the FlashFlow repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/flashflow.git
cd flashflow
```

2. Install FlashFlow in development mode:
```bash
pip install -e .
```

3. Verify the installation:
```bash
flashflow --version
```

### Setting Up Your Development Environment

1. Install required dependencies:
```bash
flashflow install core
```

2. For development tools:
```bash
flashflow install dev
```

3. For editor support:
```bash
flashflow install editor --editor vscode
```

## Creating Your First Project

### Initialize a New Project

1. Create a new FlashFlow project:
```bash
flashflow new my-first-app
cd my-first-app
```

2. Explore the project structure:
```
my-first-app/
├── flashflow.json     # Project configuration
├── src/
│   └── flows/        # Your .flow files go here
└── dist/             # Generated code will be placed here (created after build)
```

Note: The `dist/` directory is created when you run `flashflow build`. Initially, it won't exist until you generate code.

### Project Structure Details

After creating a new project, you'll have this structure:

- **[flashflow.json](file:///C:/Users/VineMaster/Desktop/flashflow/demo_project/flashflow.json)**: Contains project metadata, framework choices, and dependencies
- **src/**: Source directory for all your application logic
  - **flows/**: Directory where you place all your .flow files
- **dist/**: Generated code directory (created after build)
  - **backend/**: Generated Laravel/PHP backend code
  - **frontend/**: Generated React/PWA frontend code
  - **mobile/**: Generated Flet mobile app code

### Configure Your Project

Edit the `flashflow.json` file to configure your project:

```json
{
  "name": "my-first-app",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "description": "My first FlashFlow application",
  "author": "Your Name",
  "frameworks": {
    "backend": "laravel",
    "frontend": "react",
    "mobile": "flet",
    "database": "sqlite"
  },
  "dependencies": []
}
```

## Understanding .flow Files

.flow files are the core of FlashFlow applications. They use YAML syntax to define your entire application in one place.

### Basic Structure

A typical .flow file contains these main sections:
- **Project metadata**: Application name, version, description
- **Models**: Data structure definitions
- **Pages**: User interface definitions
- **Endpoints**: API endpoint definitions
- **Authentication**: Security configurations
- **Theme**: Visual styling

### Example .flow File Structure

```yaml
# Application metadata
name: "My Application"
version: "1.0.0"
description: "A sample FlashFlow application"

# Data models
model:
  # Model definitions here

# User interface
page:
  # Page definitions here

# API endpoints
endpoint:
  # Endpoint definitions here

# Authentication
authentication:
  # Auth definitions here

# Theme
theme:
  # Theme definitions here
```

## Designing Your Application

### Planning Your Application

Before writing code, plan your application:

1. **Define the purpose**: What problem does your app solve?
2. **Identify key features**: What functionality is essential?
3. **Determine data requirements**: What information will you store?
4. **Plan user interactions**: How will users interact with your app?

### Creating a Feature List

Document your application's features:
- User registration and login
- Data management (create, read, update, delete)
- Reporting and analytics
- Notifications
- File uploads

### Designing the User Experience

1. **Sketch wireframes**: Draw basic layouts for key screens
2. **Plan navigation**: How will users move between sections?
3. **Consider responsive design**: How will it look on mobile devices?
4. **Plan user flows**: What steps do users take to complete tasks?

## Implementing Data Models

### Defining Your First Model

Create a simple model in your .flow file:

```yaml
model:
  name: "User"
  fields:
    - name: "username"
      type: "string"
      required: true
      unique: true
    - name: "email"
      type: "string"
      required: true
    - name: "created_at"
      type: "datetime"
      default: "now"
```

### Advanced Model Features

Add relationships and constraints:

```yaml
model:
  name: "Product"
  fields:
    - name: "name"
      type: "string"
      required: true
    - name: "price"
      type: "decimal"
      required: true
    - name: "description"
      type: "text"
    - name: "category"
      type: "string"
      enum: ["electronics", "clothing", "books"]
    - name: "in_stock"
      type: "boolean"
      default: true
    - name: "created_at"
      type: "datetime"
      default: "now"
  relationships:
    - name: "reviews"
      type: "hasMany"
      model: "Review"
```

### Model Validation Rules

Add validation to ensure data integrity:

```yaml
model:
  name: "User"
  fields:
    - name: "email"
      type: "string"
      required: true
      validation:
        - rule: "email"
        - rule: "unique"
    - name: "password"
      type: "string"
      required: true
      validation:
        - rule: "min_length"
          value: 8
        - rule: "complexity"
          requirements: ["uppercase", "lowercase", "number", "special"]
```

## Creating User Interfaces

### Designing Your First Page

Create a basic page in your .flow file:

```yaml
page:
  title: "User Dashboard"
  path: "/dashboard"
  layout: "default"
  body:
    - component: "header"
      content: "Welcome to Your Dashboard"
    - component: "card"
      title: "User Information"
      content: "{{ user.username }}"
```

### Using Advanced Components

Implement complex UI with advanced components:

```yaml
page:
  title: "Product Catalog"
  path: "/products"
  layout: "default"
  auth: true
  body:
    - component: "navbar"
      items:
        - label: "Home"
          link: "/"
        - label: "Products"
          link: "/products"
    - component: "hero"
      title: "Our Products"
      subtitle: "Browse our amazing collection"
    - component: "product_list"
      data_source: "Product"
      filters:
        - field: "category"
          type: "select"
        - field: "price"
          type: "range"
```

### Responsive Design

Ensure your UI works on all devices:

```yaml
page:
  title: "Responsive Page"
  path: "/responsive"
  responsive:
    mobile:
      layout: "mobile"
      components:
        - component: "mobile_header"
        - component: "mobile_menu"
    tablet:
      layout: "tablet"
      components:
        - component: "tablet_sidebar"
    desktop:
      layout: "desktop"
      components:
        - component: "desktop_sidebar"
```

## Defining API Endpoints

### Creating Basic Endpoints

Define simple API endpoints:

```yaml
endpoint:
  path: "/api/users"
  method: "GET"
  auth: "jwt"
  response:
    type: "array"
    model: "User"
```

### Advanced Endpoint Configuration

Implement complex endpoints with validation:

```yaml
endpoint:
  path: "/api/products"
  method: "POST"
  auth: "jwt"
  rate_limit: "100/hour"
  request:
    type: "object"
    model: "Product"
  response:
    type: "object"
    model: "Product"
  handler:
    action: "create_record"
    model: "Product"
```

### Error Handling

Define custom error responses:

```yaml
endpoint:
  path: "/api/products/{id}"
  method: "DELETE"
  auth: "jwt"
  response:
    type: "object"
    model: "Product"
  errors:
    - code: 404
      message: "Product not found"
    - code: 403
      message: "Not authorized to delete this product"
```

## Adding Authentication

### Basic Authentication Setup

Configure authentication in your .flow file:

```yaml
authentication:
  providers:
    - name: "local"
      type: "email_password"
    - name: "google"
      type: "oauth2"
      client_id: "your-google-client-id"
    - name: "github"
      type: "oauth2"
      client_id: "your-github-client-id"
  jwt:
    secret: "your-jwt-secret"
    expiration: "24h"
```

### Protected Routes

Protect your pages and endpoints:

```yaml
page:
  title: "Protected Dashboard"
  path: "/dashboard"
  auth: true
  roles: ["user", "admin"]

endpoint:
  path: "/api/admin/users"
  method: "GET"
  auth: "jwt"
  roles: ["admin"]
```

### Social Authentication

Enable social login providers:

```yaml
authentication:
  social:
    google:
      enabled: true
      client_id: "your-google-client-id"
      client_secret: "your-google-client-secret"
      scopes: ["email", "profile"]
    facebook:
      enabled: true
      client_id: "your-facebook-app-id"
      client_secret: "your-facebook-app-secret"
      scopes: ["email", "public_profile"]
```

## Implementing Business Logic

### Using Services

Implement business logic with services:

```yaml
service:
  name: "EmailService"
  methods:
    - name: "sendWelcomeEmail"
      parameters:
        - name: "user"
          type: "User"
      implementation: |
        // Send welcome email to user
        // Implementation details here
```

### Creating Workflows

Define complex business workflows:

```yaml
workflow:
  name: "OrderProcessing"
  steps:
    - name: "validateOrder"
      service: "OrderService"
      method: "validate"
    - name: "processPayment"
      service: "PaymentService"
      method: "charge"
      on_error: "refundPayment"
    - name: "updateInventory"
      service: "InventoryService"
      method: "deduct"
    - name: "sendConfirmation"
      service: "EmailService"
      method: "sendOrderConfirmation"
```

### Event Handling

Implement event-driven architecture:

```yaml
events:
  - name: "user_registered"
    handlers:
      - service: "EmailService"
        method: "sendWelcomeEmail"
      - service: "AnalyticsService"
        method: "trackRegistration"
  - name: "order_placed"
    handlers:
      - service: "InventoryService"
        method: "reserveItems"
      - service: "NotificationService"
        method: "sendOrderNotification"
```

## Testing Your Application

### Writing Unit Tests

Create unit tests using .testflow files:

```yaml
test:
  name: "User Registration Test"
  description: "Test user registration functionality"
  steps:
    - action: "visit"
      url: "/register"
    - action: "fill"
      field: "email"
      value: "test@example.com"
    - action: "fill"
      field: "password"
      value: "SecurePass123!"
    - action: "click"
      element: "submit_button"
    - action: "assert"
      condition: "status_code"
      value: 201
```

### Integration Testing

Test complete workflows:

```yaml
test:
  name: "Complete Order Flow"
  description: "Test the complete order placement workflow"
  steps:
    - action: "login"
      credentials:
        email: "test@example.com"
        password: "SecurePass123!"
    - action: "visit"
      url: "/products"
    - action: "add_to_cart"
      product_id: "123"
      quantity: 2
    - action: "proceed_to_checkout"
    - action: "fill"
      field: "shipping_address"
      value: "123 Main St, City, State"
